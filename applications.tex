Informed by previous section.


\section{Applications}

Root causes.

It would be great to get examples of each of the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item path change $\rightarrow$ performance event
	\item path change $\rightarrow$ volume change (contact Jia Wang or someone else at AT\&T)
	\item path change $\rightarrow$ routing instability (bad gadgets) 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Current status}: Way too far in the future to have anything done.
