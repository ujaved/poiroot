\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we described an algorithm and a scalable system, \ouralgo, for accurately and precisely 
identifying the network responsible for Internet path changes, even in the face of 
induced path changes and incomplete information. We developed a general algorithm for identifying the root 
cause of path changes, then used simple, validated assumptions about routing behavior 
to derive new constraints on the networks that can possibly be responsible for a path change. 
We then designed a system to gather the requisite path information and produced an 
algorithm that identifies the root cause of a path change even with missing measurements. Finally, 
we evaluated \ouralgo using ground truth from path changes induced on real Internet 
paths, empirically informed simulations and natural path changes ``in the wild.'' We showed 
that previous approaches to root cause analysis can either be accurate or precise, while our 
approach achieves both. As part of our future work, we are investigating ways to use 
this root cause information to automatically address routing changes that negatively impact 
performance.
